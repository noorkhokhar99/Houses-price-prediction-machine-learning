# 1-Numpy: 

derived from two words Num means “Numerical” and py means “Python”, used for working with arrays, for fast processing, and for mathematical operations. Already downloaded with anaconda installation. if not so download it with the below command,

pip install numpy


# 2-Pandas: 

used for reading, making, writing datasets from different resources, and making datasets on their own. download it with the below command,


pip install pandas



# 3-Seaborn & Matplotlib: 

most popular and useful libraries for data visualization. you can download them with the below command,

pip install matplotlib seaborn



# 4-Sklearn: 

Among the most popular and useful libraries that support almost all machine learning algorithms like classification, regression, clustering, etc. you can download it with the below command,


pip install sklearn


Now, we will move towards the building model so let's start step by step.



# Pickle5: used for deploying a machine learning model. you can download it with the below command.
